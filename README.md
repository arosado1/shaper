# Tools for ZInvisible dilepton analysis


ShapeNormGen.py  -  Calculate shape and normalization factors with different variables
ShapeSyst.py     -  Calculate shape factor systematic uncertainty
Prediction.py    -  Make Z to invisible prediction table and histogram
TotalSyst.py     -  Calculate the total systematics uncertainty from MC


In modules:
LoadHistograms.py - Load different histograms from result.root; it is used by most scripts.
LowDMHighMET\_merger.py - Merge LowDM with LowDMHighMET in the validation bins
